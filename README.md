# Prototype-RollerCoaster

## Disclaimer!
  I am unfortunately not able to share this source code due to academic integerity. However, I am able to share the executable and media files, so any interested people are able to run the application themselves. 

The Program was written in C++ utilizing:
- OpenGL
- Microsoft Visual Studios C++.

### SkyBox
### Track

### Camera Control

### Basic Shading: Lighting of Normals
When light hits an object, an important fraction of it is reflected in all directions.
When a certain flux of light arrives at the surface, this surface is illuminated differently according to the angle at which the light arrives. If the light is perpendicular to the surface, it is concentrated on a small surface. If it arrives at a gazing angle, the same quantity of light spreads on a greater surface. This means that when we compute the colour of a pixel, the angle between the incoming light and the surface normal matters.

By accurately computing the normals of my track, the lighting on my track produced a very high degree of visual realism.

    
  

## How to Run the Program:
  Download the Project_1.rar
  
  KEEP ALL FILE NAMES THE SAME and the same order.
  
  Double-click Project1.exe. 

## How was the Track Created?

   We utilized 

##  Preamble

Press T to get on the track and press again to get off track

Press the U,I,O to increase transformations

Press the J,K,L to decrease transformations

Shift+Key will alter scale

Control+Key will alter translation

Key along will alter rotation rate

Pressing Comma will increase transformation Step

Pressing Period will decrease transformation Step

Pressing G will reset transformations

Pressing Q will toggle Quaternion Rotation

Pressing B will toggle reflections for the box textures

Pressing H will toggle heightmap

Pressing N will toggle Normals

Pressing P will print information


### Software Used
- OpenGL
- Microsoft Visual Studios C++.
